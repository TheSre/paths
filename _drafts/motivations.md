TODO: hopefully done w rough draft, just look over

I hope to correctly identify the cause areas that will be most impactful to
contribute to because I want to have a significant positive impact on the
world and believe that some approaches to improving the world are much more
impactful than others. For example, the US government (the EPA) [is willing
to spend $7.4 million (amount from 2006) to save a
life](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation).
Adjusting the 2006 amount to 2021 yields a figure of about
$9.9 million[^1]. [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/) estimates that
the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) was [able to save a life
for roughly $5500 on
average](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) in 2021. The number the
U.S. government is willing to spend is about 1,801 times GiveWell's estimate[^2].
Given that we have limited resources, these differences in
cost-effectiveness mean that some approaches to helping others are much
more impactful than others. For example, let's take the [average annual
wage in the U.S. from May
2021](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000): $58,260. If
someone donated 10% of their income each year for 35 years, this would
yield $203,910 given to help others. If the person gave it to AMF, they'd
be able to save something on the order of 37 lives (again, see [^2] on the
accuracy and usage of cost-effectiveness estimates). If the person spent
the money in line with the US government's threshold value, then they'd
have saved 0.02 lives. Hopefully, this example highlights how significantly
cause areas can differ in impact and the urgency of finding the ones that
are most impactful.

[^2]: Note: the GiveWell estimate shouldn't be taken as a solid, exact amount, but instead as a useful way to get a rough, ballpark idea of the differences in cost-effectiveness between two programs. Quoting from [their site](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models), "We view cost-effectiveness analyses as valuable for helping us identify large differences in the cost-effectiveness of organizations we're considering for a recommendation and to encourage staff to think through relevant issues related to charities' work. However, although we spend significant staff time on our cost-effectiveness analyses, we consider our cost-effectiveness numbers to be extremely rough."
