# Intro: Purpose and Limitations
I’m planning to take some time to think over cause prioritization in order to
decide which cause areas or paths are most impactful for me to contribute to.
I’d like to be thorough and rigorous. I believe that being right or wrong about
these questions will very significantly affect how much positive impact I can
have with my life. Thus, I think these are among the most important questions I
could try to answer. However, I'm doing this alongside a full-time job in the
context of an already busy life. Therefore, I aim to be practical and efficient
with this process. Many of the individual sub-questions I'm mulling over could
probably be thought about and investigated for years. For now, there are many
stones I'll need to leave unturned. Unfortunately, this means that many of the
investigations will likely feel rushed or unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, these
considerations will hopefully serve as a solid foundation and starting point. I
imagine I’ll be refining these ideas over the course of many years, or even
decades.
